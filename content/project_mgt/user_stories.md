title: "User stories"

---

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

A user story typically follow a simple template:

    As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.  

User stories can be written on cards or sticky notes, stores on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion.

They can be written at varying levels of detail. The large user stories are generally known as epics.
The epic is usually split into smaller user stories independent from one another so the team can worked on.
