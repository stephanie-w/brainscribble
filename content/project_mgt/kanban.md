title: "Kanban Practices"

---

## Core Kanban practices :

* Visualize the workflow
* Limit your Work in Progress (WiP)
* Manage the Flow
    * Visualize blocked items, long queues, empty spaces
    * Deal with indicators of problems
* Implement Feedback Loops
* Make Process Policies Explicit
* Improve Collaboratively


## Composants:

* Product backlog:
* Kanban Cards:
* Columne representing the diffrent stages of the life-cycle of a task/story

## Kanban Metrics:

* Team metrics:
    * End to end Lead Time : The median time in which a card goes from being created to being closed. It's the metric of the team's efficiency
* Card metrics:
    * Delivery Lead Time : The time a card spend out of the backlog. This show how much card are waiting in the current pipeline

Cumulative Flow Diagrams : representation of the relative amount of work for each stage of project over the time. The diagram should run smoothly. Large steps and flat horizontal lines indicate impediments to flow or lack of flow. Variations in the gap or bands stand for bottleneck situations, which usually occur due to irrelevant work in progress limits.

Stacked bar chart representing how much time a task has spent in a given state through is life-cycle, allowing the detection of tasks that are taking too long.

Kanban Strategies:
a kanban by team? a kanban by team seems more as one of the goal is to improve collaborative work.  
project name
starttime and startdate
type : bug vs feature vs tech debt (usually code enhancements)


a kanban by project?

Cycle time : a measure at the elapsed time from the moment you start working on a story until it is done. Different teams will use different definitions for start and done ("accepted by the product owner" vs "delivered to production").

## Building a kanban

Methodologies to validate the model:

* Produce a sketch from your top-down or bottom-up model.
* Make sure that actual work items map to your sketch or top-down model, then use the “what does this item need?” questions.
* Consider whether it would be helpful to group, consolidate, or break down categories.
