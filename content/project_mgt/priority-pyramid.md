title: "The priority pyramid"

---

The priority pyramid is a visualized backlog with a prioritization process.

![Priority Pyramid](figure/priority_pyramid.png =600x500)

The pyramid has four level:

* Priority One : The top of the pyramid which contains tasks/user stories with highest priority.
* Priority Two : The middle of the pyramid which contains tasks/user stories that will be started as soon as resources will be available.
* Priority Three : The bottom of the pyramid which contains tasks/user stories that will be worked on soon.

Then the rest of the backlog below the pyramid.

To each pyramid level is associated a maximum number of tasks/user stories a level can contain, the WIP-limit (Work-in-Process limitations).
